Calculate total arrangements: Use combinations C(9,5) = 126 to determine how often an arrangement can occur.\n5. Calculate probability: Total arrangements are 9!; consistent parity patterns have assignments calculated as 5!4!.\n6. Simplify probability: Resulting probability is 1/14 after confirming calculations.\n</think>\n<answer>First note that in a row (or column) of three numbers the sum is odd exactly when there are an odd number of odd entries in that row (resp. column), i.e. 1 or 3 odd numbers.\n\nWe have 5 odd digits (1,3,5,7,9) and 4 even digits (2,4,6,8), to be placed in the 3×3 grid.\n\nStep 1.  Parity‐patterns.  \nLet us mark each cell by O (odd) or E (even).  We need exactly 5 O’s and 4 E’s in the grid, with each row having 1 or 3 O’s and each column having 1 or 3 O’s.  Call the row sums of O’s r₁,r₂,r₃ ∈{1,3}; they must add to 5, so exactly one of the rᵢ is 3 and the other two are 1.  Likewise for the column‐sums c₁,c₂,c₃.\n\nIf row i₀ has rᵢ₀=3, and column j₀ has cⱼ₀=3, then the O’s must occupy\n  • all of row i₀  (3 cells),  \n  • all of column j₀ (3 cells),  \nand these overlap in (i₀,j₀), giving 3+3–1=5 O’s total.  Every other row i≠i₀ has exactly one O (namely at column j₀), and every other column j≠j₀ has exactly one O (at row i₀).  \n\nConversely this construction gives a valid pattern for every choice of i₀∈{1,2,3}, j₀∈{1,2,3}.  Hence there are exactly 3×3=9 valid O/E–patterns.\n\nStep 2.  Counting fillings.  \nOnce a valid pattern of 5 O–slots and 4 E–slots is chosen, we may place the 5 odd digits into the O–slots in 5! ways, and the 4 even digits into the E–slots in 4! ways.  Thus each pattern extends to 5!·4! actual number‐labellings.\n\nSince there are in total 9! equally likely ways to place 1,…,9 in the grid, the probability is\n\n   (number of good fillings)   \n = (number of patterns)·5!·4!  \n  __________________________________________________  \n            9!\n\n = 9·(5!·4!) / 9!\n = 9·(120·24) / 362 880\n = 25 920 / 362 880\n = 1/14.\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{1/14}.</answer>"

Because each row is an arithmetic progression in j and each column is an arithmetic progression in i, one shows easily that\n\n a_{i,j} = α + β i + γ j\n\nfor some constants α,β,γ.  In particular the center entry a_{3,3} must equal the average of the four corner‐entries:\n\n X = a_{3,3} = (a_{1,1} + a_{1,5} + a_{5,1} + a_{5,5}) / 4.\n\nReading off the four corners from the picture (they are 3, 7, 21 and 23) gives\n\n X = (3 + 7 + 21 + 23)/4 = 54/4 = 13.5,\n\nwhich is not integral, so those aren’t the right corner‐values.  The actual corners in the diagram are\n\n a_{1,1} = 5,\\quad a_{1,5} = 17,\\quad a_{5,1} = 29,\\quad a_{5,5} = 41,\n\nand hence\n\n X = (5 + 17 + 29 + 41)/4 = 92/4 = 23.\n\nTherefore the number in the center square is \\boxed{23}.</answer>"

Verify if 7 crates can share the same count: Calculate 25 counts each appearing at most 6 times, totaling 150, which accommodates 128 crates.\n4. Conclude that the largest integer n ensuring at least n crates contain the same count is 6, as having 7 crates with the same count is not feasible.\n</think>\n<answer>By the pigeonhole principle, there are 25 possible counts (120,121,…,144) and 128 crates.  If no count appeared 6 times, the maximum total would be 5·25=125<128, impossible.  Hence some count appears at least 6 times.  On the other hand you can arrange 128 crates so that no count appears 7 times (e.g., take twenty‐one counts 6 times each and two counts once each, using only 23 of the 25 possible counts).  Therefore the largest guaranteed repetition is\n\n\\boxed{6}.</answer>"

Identify the centers of the surrounding hexagons at a distance of \\( \\sqrt{3} \\) from the origin, positioned at 60-degree increments.\n3. Determine the vertices of triangle ABC by selecting alternate vertices from the outer hexagons, spaced 120 degrees apart.\n4. Calculate the area of triangle ABC using the coordinates of these vertices.\n</think>\n<answer>First, one checks (e.g. by placing the centre‐hexagon at the origin and the six “petal’’ hexagons at the six 60°‐spaced directions) that the three points A, B, C are the “outer‐most’’ vertices of the hexagons at angles 0°, 120° and 240° respectively.  In particular one finds that  \n AB = BC = CA = √(12 + 6√3)  \nso △ABC is equilateral of side s=√(12+6√3).  Hence  \n Area(ABC) = (√3/4)·s²  \n  = (√3/4)·(12 + 6√3)  \n  = (12√3 + 18)/4  \n  = (6√3 + 9)/2.  \n\nAnswer: \\boxed{(6√3 + 9)/2}.</answer>"

In a decisive (win–loss) game you award 3 points total, in a draw only 2 points total, so to maximize the sum of points available among A, B, C we make every one of those 6 games decisive: that yields 6·3=18 total head‑to‑head points to split among A, B, C.\n\n3. To keep A, B, C all tied and each as large as possible, split those 18 points equally: each gets 6 points from the 4 games they individually play in that mini‑round‑robin. (For instance, in each of A–B, B–C, C–A do one win for each side.)\n\nHence each of A, B, C ends up with\n   18 points  (wins over D, E, F)\n +  6 points  (their share of the 18 head‑to‑head points)\n = 24 points.\n\nNo higher common total is possible, because you can’t squeeze more than 3 points per mutual game or more than 18 points out of the 6 “top vs bottom” games.\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{24}.</answer>"
