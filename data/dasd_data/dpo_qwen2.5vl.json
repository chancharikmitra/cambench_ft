Since \\(AB\\) and \\(CD\\) are parallel and equal in length, and considering the properties of the sectors and the given lengths, we can infer that the height from A to BC (let's call it \\(h\\)) is related to the radius of the sector.\n\nUsing the area of the EAB sector:\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times AB \\times h = 157 \\]\n\\[ 157 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times AB \\times h \\]\n\\[ h = \\frac{2 \\times 157}{AB} \\]\n\nSince \\(h\\) is also the perpendicular distance from A to BC, and knowing that \\(h\\) is related to the radius of the sector, we can approximate:\n\\[ h \\approx r \\approx 35.9 \\]\n\nThus:\n\\[ 157 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times AB \\times 35.9 \\]\n\\[ AB = \\frac{157 \\times 2}{35.9} \\approx \\frac{314}{35.9} \\approx 8.78 \\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the perimeter\nThe perimeter \\(P\\) of the parallelogram \\(ABCD\\) is:\n\\[ P = 2 \\times (AB + AD) \\]\n\\[ P = 2 \\times (8.78 + 18) \\]\n\\[ P = 2 \\times 26.78 \\]\n\\[ P \\approx 53.56 \\]\n\nTherefore, the perimeter of the parallelogram \\(ABCD\\) is:\n\\[ \\boxed{53.56} \\]"

Thus, Area(ABC) = 4 * Area(ADE).\n\n3. **Identifying G and Area Relationships:** G is the midpoint of EC, leading to triangles CGE and CGF having equal heights from C to EF. Since GE = GC, Area(CGE) = Area(CGF) = 2.\n\n4. **Analyzing Triangle DCE:** Triangles DCE and ABC are also similar with a ratio of 1:2. Hence, Area(DCE) = (1/4) * Area(ABC).

The area ratio of triangles AGC and AFC becomes GC/FC = 1/3, allowing us to deduce Area(AFC) = 6.\n\n6. **Final Area Calculation:** With Area(CGF) = 2 and Area(AFC) = 6, we confirm Area(ABC) = 16 through consistent area relations.\n\nThe area of triangle ABC is thus \\\\boxed{16}.\n</think> <answer>\\boxed{D}</answer>"

Therefore:\n   \\[\n   ∠α + 55° = 180° \\implies ∠α = 180° - 55° = 125°.\n   \\]\n\n7. **Finding the correct angle:** Since ∠B is also an exterior angle to triangle ABC, we use the correct relationship:\n   \\[\n   ∠B = 180° - β = 180° - 55° = 125°.\n   \\]\n\n8. **Final calculation:** The angles in triangle ABC must satisfy:\n   \\[\n   ∠A + ∠B + ∠C = 180° \\implies ∠A + 90° + 125° = 180° \\implies ∠A = 180° - 215° = -35°,\n   \\]\n   which is impossible. Reassessing, we find that:\n   \\[\n   ∠B = 55° \\text{ (from alternate interior angles)}.\n   \\]\n\n9. **Correct calculation of ∠A:** Thus:\n   \\[\n   ∠A + 55° + 90° = 180° \\implies ∠A = 180° - 145° = 35°.\n   \\]\n\n10. **Conclusion:** Therefore, the value of ∠α is:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{35}.\n   \\]\n</think> <answer>\\boxed{35°}</answer>"

Thus, each small triangle has an area of (1/6) * Area(ABC) = (1/6) * 12 = 2.\n\n4. **Area of Triangle ABD:** By the properties of medians, Area(ABD) = Area(ACD) = (1/2) * Area(ABC) = (1/2) * 12 = 6.\n\n5. **Area of Triangle ADF:** Triangles ADF and ABD share the same height from A to BC. The ratio of their bases (BD:AD) is 1:2, leading to the area ratio being the same. Therefore, Area(ADF) = (1/3) * Area(ABD) = (1/3) * 6 = 2.\n\n6. **Area of Triangle CEF:** The area of triangle ABC equals the sum of areas of triangles ADF, BDF, CEF, and CDE. Since D is the centroid, Area(CEF) can be calculated as Area(BDF) + Area(ADE) = 2(1/6)*Area(ABC) = (2/6)*12 = 4. Thus, Area(CEF) = 4.\n\n7. **Difference in Areas:** The difference in areas is calculated as: Area(CEF) - Area(ADF) = 4 - 2 = 2.\n</think>\n\n\\(\\boxed{2}\\) <answer>\\boxed{B}</answer>"

The area of triangle ADF can be calculated using the ratio of the bases and heights.\n\n   The area of triangle ADF is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of } \\triangle ADF = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\text{Area of } \\triangle ABC = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 12 = 4\n   \\]\n\n   Similarly, the area of triangle CEF can be determined using the same logic. Since E divides BC in some ratio (which we don't know explicitly but we can infer it from the symmetry of the problem), the area of triangle CEF will be the remaining part of the area after removing the areas of triangles ADF and BDE.\n\n3. **Calculate the area of triangle CEF:**\n   The area of triangle BDE can be calculated similarly:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of } \\triangle BDE = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\text{Area of } \\triangle ABC = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 12 = 4\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the area of triangle CEF is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of } \\triangle CEF = \\text{Area of } \\triangle ABC - \\text{Area of } \\triangle ADF - \\text{Area of } \\triangle BDE = 12 - 4 - 4 = 4\n   \\]\n\n4. **Find the difference between the areas of triangle ADF and triangle CEF:**\n   \\[\n   p = \\text{Area of } \\triangle ADF - \\text{Area of } \\triangle CEF = 4 - 4 = 0\n   \\]\n\nHowever, there seems to be an error in the interpretation or calculation.

The correct difference should be:\n\\[\np = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 12 - \\frac{1}{3} \\times 12 = 0\n\\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\\boxed{0}"

The Sun is at the center of the image, which is consistent with the Earth's position in space relative to the Sun.\n\nNow, let's consider the positions:\n- Position A: This appears to be the farthest point from the Sun, indicating the Earth is at one of the solstices (Summer or Winter).\n- Position B: This is closer to the Sun compared to A but farther than C and D, suggesting it could be Spring or Fall.\n- Position C: This is the farthest point from the Sun again, indicating the other solstice (Winter or Summer).\n- Position D: This is between A and C, but closer to the Sun than A, suggesting it could be Spring or Fall.\n\nGiven that position B is between two points where the Earth is further away from the Sun, it is more likely to be either Spring or Fall.

Thus, AC = √32 = 4√2 m.\n\n7. **Verification:** The previous reasoning incorrectly applied the law of cosines on triangle ADC. The horizontal distance changes when the angle shifts to 45 degrees, confirming that AC = 4√2 m is correct.\n</think>\n\n\\boxed{4\\sqrt{2}} <answer>\\boxed{B}</answer>"

The length of the CF side is given as 16, which is the height of the semi-circle plus the height of the rectangle. Since the semi-circle has a radius equal to the width of the rectangle, let's denote the width of the rectangle by \\( w \\).

Similarly, point H is the reflection of P across line ON, making ON the perpendicular bisector of segment PH.

Triangle ABC is inscribed in the circle with angle ∠ACB = 30°, which subtends an arc.\n\n2. **Midpoint and Perpendicularity:** Point D, the midpoint of chord AB, means that OD is perpendicular to AB (∠ODA = 90°), forming right triangle ODA.\n\n3. **Isosceles Triangle and Angle Bisector:** Triangle OAB is isosceles (OA = OB). OD bisects angle AOB, leading to ∠AOD = ∠BOD.\n\n4. **Central Angle and Inscribed Angle:** The central angle ∠AOB is twice the inscribed angle ∠ACB, thus ∠AOB = 2 * 30° = 60°.\n\n5. **Right Triangle Trigonometry:** In right triangle ODA, OA = 6 units and ∠AOD = 30°. Using cosine: OD = OA * cos(30°) = 6 * (√3/2) = 3√3 units.\n\n6. **Alternative Approach:** Using the inscribed angle theorem, ∠AOB = 60° confirms triangle AOB is isosceles, and OD is the perpendicular bisector.

To find ∠AOB, we need to determine the angles in triangle AOC.\n\n4. **Finding ∠AOC:** In triangle AOC, since OA = OC (radii), it is isosceles. Given ∠OAC = 40°, we have ∠OCA = 40°. Therefore, ∠AOC = 180° - 40° - 40° = 100°.\n\n5. **Arc AC:** The measure of arc AC is equal to the central angle ∠AOC, which is 100°.\n\n6. **Total Angle at Center:** The angles around point O sum to 360°.

Since the triangle is equilateral, its height can be calculated using the formula for the height of an equilateral triangle:\n\\[ h = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}a \\]\n\nThe area of the rectangle is \\( l \\times w \\), and the area of the equilateral triangle is \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}a^2 \\).

The key steps involve calculating the side lengths of the shapes involved and then using these to find the radius of the sector.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the dimensions of the BCDE shape\nThe BCDE shape is a rectangle with a semi-circle removed from one of its sides. The perimeter of this shape is given as 78. Let's denote:\n- \\( BC = x \\)\n- \\( CD = y \\)\n\nThe perimeter of the BCDE shape is the sum of all its sides, which includes the two full sides (BC and CD) plus the three straight edges forming the semi-circle (BD, DE, and the arc of the semi-circle).\n\nThe perimeter can be expressed as:\n\\[ 2x + y + BD + DE + \\text{arc length} = 78 \\]\n\nSince BD and DE form the diameter of the semi-circle, the arc length of the semi-circle is \\( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\times \\text{diameter} \\). The diameter is equal to \\( y \\), so the arc length is \\( \\frac{\\pi}{2} y \\).\n\nThus, the perimeter equation becomes:\n\\[ 2x + y + y + \\frac{\\pi}{2} y = 78 \\]\n\\[ 2x + 2y + \\frac{\\pi}{2} y = 78 \\]\n\nGiven \\( \\pi \\approx 3.14 \\):\n\\[ 2x + 2y + 1.57y = 78 \\]\n\\[ 2x + 3.57y = 78 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Use the coordinates of points G and D to find the length of BC and CD\nPoint G is at (7, 0) and point D is at (0, 13). The distance between G and D gives us the length of the hypotenuse of the right triangle GCD:\n\\[ GD = \\sqrt{(7 - 0)^2 + (0 - 13)^2} = \\sqrt{49 + 169} = \\sqrt{218} \\approx 14.77 \\]\n\nThis value does not directly help in solving the perimeter equation but confirms the orientation of the coordinates.\n\n### Step 3: Solve for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\)\nWe have two equations:\n1. \\( 2x + 3.57y = 78 \\)\n2. \\( x = y \\) (since the shape is symmetric and the problem setup suggests equal lengths for simplicity)\n\nSubstitute \\( x = y \\) into the first equation:\n\\[ 2y + 3.57y = 78 \\]\n\\[ 5.57y = 78 \\]\n\\[ y = \\frac{78}{5.57} \\approx 13.96 \\]\n\\[ x = 13.96 \\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the radius of the sector\nThe radius of the sector is the same as the length of BC, which is approximately 13.96.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the area of the sector\nThe angle of the sector is given as 55 degrees. The area of a sector is given by:\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{\\theta}{360^\\circ} \\times \\pi r^2 \\]\nwhere \\( \\theta = 55^\\circ \\) and \\( r = 13.96 \\).\n\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{55}{360} \\times \\pi \\times (13.96)^2 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{55}{360} \\times 3.14 \\times 194.88 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Area} = 0.1528 \\times 612.16 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Area} \\approx 93.84 \\]\n\nThus, the area of the ABC sector is \\boxed{93.84}."

Since E is the midpoint of AC, AE = EC = AC/2. However, we don't yet know AC.\n\n3. **Apply the Angle Bisector Theorem:** In ΔABF, BF bisects ∠ABC. The Angle Bisector Theorem states that AB/BC = AF/FC. Substituting the known values, we get 8/6 = AF/FC, which simplifies to 4/3 = AF/FC. This means that AF is 4/7 of AB and FC is 3/7 of AC. Therefore, AF = (4/7) * 8 = 32/7, and FC = (3/7)* AC.\n\n4. **Determine AC:** We can use the property of medians. The medians of a triangle intersect at the centroid, which divides each median into a 2:1 ratio. However, this is not directly applicable here because BF is not a median. We need another approach to find AC.\n\n5. **Utilize Similar Triangles (Alternative Approach):** Let's consider triangles ΔABF and ΔEBF. While they don't share an angle directly, the angles at B are related (∠ABF = ∠EBF because BF is the angle bisector). Moreover, the angles at F are vertically opposite and thus equal in both triangles. We need more information or another approach to establish similarity formally. We lack sufficient conditions to declare them definitively similar.\n\n6. **Consider the Menelaus' Theorem (Alternative Approach):** Menelaus' Theorem might be applicable to find the ratio of AE to EC. However, this requires having a transversal line intersecting the sides of a triangle. We lack this kind of setup in our problem.\n\n7. **Re-evaluate the Approach (Conclusion):** The reference solution seems to make an assumption or utilize a property not explicitly stated or demonstrable within the provided problem description and diagram.

This follows from the property of angles subtended by a diameter.\n\n2. **Use the Inscribed Angle Theorem:** The inscribed angle theorem indicates that the inscribed angle (angle ACB) is half the measure of the central angle (angle AOB) that subtends the same arc. Here, angle ACB = 90 degrees confirms that it subtends the diameter AB.\n\n3. **Analyze Triangle ABC:** In triangle ABC, we know angle ACB = 90 degrees and angle BAC = 40 degrees (as given in the problem). The sum of angles in any triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, we can write the equation: angle BAC + angle ABC + angle ACB = 180 degrees.\n\n4. **Substituting Known Values:** Substituting the known values into the equation yields: 40 + angle ABC + 90 = 180.
